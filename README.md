# Platformer-Velocity-GM
Summary:
This is my best Game Maker project. It is a platformer that heavily takes advantage of velocity and momentum to complete levels. There are a bunch of cool mechanics in this game that I want to polish and make into a completed project one day.

My Contributions:
I developed all parts of this game, it is solely my project (including the corny jokes).

Issues / What I would like to fix:
The project was rushed a bit to meet a deadline, so I didnâ€™t get to make/polish the movement or levels as much as I wanted. I do however, consider this game to be one of my best and am very proud of it.

How to play it:
To play the game you need to first download the zip, then extract the files from the application file. When that finishes you should be able to open the application.
